        <h4>What am I supposed to do when it's my turn?</h4>
        <p>
            You should pick either a faction, a slice or a position relative to speaker.

        <h4>What is a milty draft?</h4>

        <p>
            <em>(from miltydraft.com)</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            Milty Draft is a method for setting up a game of <i>Twilight Imperium: Fourth Edition<sup>®</sup></i> with the <i>Prophecy of Kings<sup>®</sup></i> expansion, by Fantasy Flight Games<sup>™</sup> (not affiliated with this website).
            It allows players to build a map, choose their faction, and organise a seating order in a balanced manner.
        </p>
        <p>
            The draft takes place over three rounds. Every round, all players get to pick their a) faction or b) map slice or c) table position (including the speaker position) until they have one of each.
            The order that players make these choices is random in the first round. The second round picks are done in the reverse order, and the third round reverts to the same order as the first round, making a boustrophedon draft.
            One all players have made their choice, the map is assembled from the slices, and players can start the game proper.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each slices consists of five systems, excluding a player’s home system. These comprise of the four systems closer to that player’s home system than any other player’s
            (two in the outer ring, one in the middle ring, and one in the inner ring), as well as the system in ring two that is equidistant to that player’s home system and the home system of the player on their left. The slices are roughly balanced using a tiered system of tiles. Each blue–backed tile is assigned one of three tiers. Then, each slice is randomly assigned one tile from each tier, along with two red–back tiles. Each slice must meet a minimum influence and resource threshold,
            as well as a minimum and maximum total threshold. In addition, slices cannot contain two of the same type of wormhole, or anomalies next to one another.
            There is an option to force the draft to include a minimum number of legendary planets, and wormholes of each type. Should these conditions not be met,
            then another set of slices is generated. Because of the way slices are assembled, anomalies may be placed next to one another if they were on the borders of
            two slices.

        <h4>What does "optimal value" mean?</h4>
        <p>
            The “Optimal Value” of a planet is calculated by using the higher of its resource value and influence value as that value, and the other value as zero.
            If both of the planet’s resource value and influence value are equal, half that value is used for both of its optimal values.
            For example, Starpoint, a 3/1, is treated as 3/0, Corneeq, a 1/2, is treated as 0/2, and Rigel III, a 1/1, is treated as ½/½.
        </p>
        <p>
            The optimal value of a system, then, is just the total of all the planet's optimal values.
        </p>

        <h4>How long can my draft stay online?</h4>
        <p>
            Well, that kind of depends on how popular this gets. Hosting isn't free, sadly, so I'm planning to weed out drafts older than one year every so often.
        </p>

        <h4>What's your privacy policy?</h4>
        <p>
            As you can see, links are public to anyone who has them, so there's technically no guarantee to privacy. I'd say: be mindful of any information you enter as player names.<br />
            Other than that we collect no personal data from you.
        </p>

        <h4>How does claiming work?</h4>
        <p>
            Once you claim a player your browser will remember you for this draft, so you don't have to keep this tab open the whole time. <br />
            If you lose access to whatever browser/device you claimed your place on the admin can make picks for you.<br />
            Pretty much the same thing happens for admins though, so if both the admin and you lose access at the same time then you're pretty much boned.
        </p>

        <h4>This thing is awesome!</h4>
        <p>
            Not really a question, but I appreciate the enthousiasm!

        <h4>This is thing is hot garbage!</h4>
        <p>
            First of all: rude. Second: Yes, there are a lot of problems with this, and stuff I haven't implemented, sure. The code is on <a href="https://github.com/shenanigans-be/miltydraft" target="_blank">Github</a> if you want to report an issue or even contribute!
